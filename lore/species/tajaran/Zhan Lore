Tajara Lore - Zhan and their Subspecies

Names and language
There are three main Zhan types: Zhan, Zhan Khazan, and Ur Zhan Khazan, they all share a grey/black (variations thereof) fur pattern. Tiger stripes are uncommon except for the Ur which all males have. Zhan names are usually guttural and “throaty” sounding, far less refined than other Tajara names. Generally a Zhan name will literally mean something. I.E. a family ‘job’ such as warrior or hunter. Examples for good Zhan names as they can vary among different tribes due to dialect, go wild. Generally try using your whole mouth to say a name or creating one.

The Zhan language is divided into Suuk’Laa and Ur. Suuk’Laa is harsh but has a written language and is generally much more structured. Ur is baffling, even to those that speak it as it often lacks much to base off of. Both Suuk’Laa and Ur are written in runes. Due to the harsh and literal nature of Zhan language (specifically Ur) things are taken very literal and there is not much room for metaphors.

Writing
	Generally when it comes to writing, the ability to write is not common. Due to that, writing is done almost entirely on stone as paper is easily lost and destroyed, scrolls do exist are usually kept for temporary short term things, but generally writing is reserved for extremely important things as runes are incredibly complex and take time to master. Typically in Zhan culture scribes, priests, chiefs, and females know how to write. Despite writing not being common, a rune, be it a clan symbol, brand, etc., they hold extremely powerful cultural meanings. While the typical Zhan might not know what the rune exactly means, they would know what it is when they see it.

Brandings and physical markings
	Given the powerful meaning of runes (and their general complexity of being single words with extremely specific meanings) typically brandings, scarring, and tattooing of the fur (usually through dyes) are common to the Zhan. To be branded holds intense meaning, and depending on what the brand means, it is either incredibly honorable, or incredibly dishonorable to be marked.

	Typically chieftains (and the clan matriarchs) are branded with their clan name on their right side, these brands typically sit between the fourth through eighth ribs and are clearly visible. 
	Priests (and priestesses) are similarly branded though the same ribs; however, instead of a clan name they are branded with the word “Zaa’Tura” and the choice between their arms being scarred or tattooed to be similar to Zaa’Keel. Some more radical priests will go through with their arms being scarred.
	Females are sometimes branded along with their mates to signify marriage between two Zhan when they share a clan name but generally the most notable body modification with meaning to females is to have tiger stripes tattooed into their fur due to a religious meaning involving Zhan mythology.
	Brandings are also reserved to serfs and servants to signify loyalty to a certain cause such as being a warrior for a certain person. These brands or dyes depending on the clan leader and very specific but are notably different than the clan name that the chieftain himself has, as a loyalty brand to a clan has usually a small change from a typical clan rune. An example of a clan rune against the serf rune, the grandeur of a clan rune is marked with intensity and jaggedness while the serf rune remains simplistic.
	
	The worst brand one can receive is oathbreaker, unlike most brandings that are usually treated and cared for, to be oathbreaker you are stripped of everything, clan, title, and livelihood. You are cast from your home and given a painful brand from your lower right side to your shoulder with whatever crime you have done. Sometimes oathbreaker runes are unique given the different crimes that occur, but they all share a half moon-like shape.

Zhan species
	Typically a Zhan Tajara male stands somewhere at 5’8” (170cm) and close to about 150 pounds (~70kg) Females are slightly shorter at 5’5” (~167cm) and weighing in around 140 pounds (~60kg).
		- Zhan are your more “darker furred” Tajara, nothing of note from your typical Tajara aside from being a little taller and heavier. There is the typical and normal males being larger than females. Again normal Tajara, just with black fur, sometimes the fur color can range to a darker chocolate color.
		- Zhan Khazan are definitely the work horse of the Tajara people. Stocky, broad shouldered, and muscular. The odd middle ground when it comes to gender dimorphism, Zhan Khazan females look identical to males aside from the obvious breasts and female facial structure.
		- Ur Zhan, are generally the rarest of the ‘Zhan’ but are undeniably the largest, strongest, and easily, the most brutish. Unlike the Zhan and Zhan Khazan, female Ur are actually larger than males, usually by a good 4-5 inches at times. Their muscular frames are more refined and athletic but they still look incredibly female. Ur are easily over 6’ tall (180cm+) and females are usually much taller than males.

Distinctions among the Zhan and their place in the clan
	Generally clans can be a mixture of the three sub species of Zhan.
		- The ‘normal’ Zhan are usually your typical member and the ‘face’ of the clans. Generally they are merchants, artists, priests, and most normal jobs. 
		- The Zhan Khazan are more for the laborious tasks in the clan, may it be mining, being blacksmiths, hunting, and fighting. 
		- Ur Zhan are reserved purely for fighting, hunting, and purely combat. They also are the most likely to become chiefs due to their large size and pure strength. Female Ur have a special place as generally unlike their male counterparts, the female Ur tend to have some self-control, and generally are the ones to manage the home and clan and even diplomacy less their husbands/ sons/ brothers kill or ruin negotiations. 


Zhan Religion
	The Zhan religion is quite different than the typical religion practiced by many of S’randarr and Messa that is common. The religion of the Zhan is a pantheon of a multitude of gods not unlike that of Greek/ Nordic/ Aztecan mythos. Generally known as “Zaa’Tura” derived from the union of the two head deities in the pantheon.

•	Zaa’Keel “Lord of the Frost”-He is the King of the gods that rules with an iron fist. He is described as wild, bombastic, and lacking much self-control, a pure Ur Zhan god that is strong, aggressive, and loyal.  He is not a trickster and all he does is true and heartless as he is the god of the winter and death. He carries a large great-axe made of pure ice. What is most notable is his large arm brand that wraps down his arm in a spiral pattern from a battle he received in the past. He is a deep concrete grey colored Ur Zhan with black tiger stripes.

•	Kii’Tura “The Wise Queen”- The wife to Zaa’Keel. Unlike her husband, Kii is much more reserved and quiet. Though she is the goddess of judgement and righteousness. Though what is “righteous” and what is not generally changes. When one dies, Zaa’Keel brings the dead to his wife so that they are judged for all they have done in their life. She is a pure white furred Tajara, perhaps even believed and told to be an Albino Ur woman, she also has tiger stripes marked into her white fur. She is also described as being tall and thin, but a face undeniably and purely neutral.

•	Rit’Keel-Garar “Lord of the Sea”- God of the Sea and Winds, the younger brother to Kii’Tura, Rit’Garar is neither benevolent nor evil. He is described as a young Zhan man with a cloak made of sea weed and riding a great sea serpent. He controls the chilling seas and winds and generally it is seen as a good idea to praise him before setting sail on the blistering cold sea.

•	Redouane “Glorious Death”- God of War, battle, and luck. The son of Zaa and Kii. A god not one to anger or displease he revels in violence and gore. A common trait for many Zhan Tajara is to practically roar his name before any sort of battle that involves violence. Less they not die gloriously. He is much like his father, yet he is so blood and violence soaked his fur is described as red and dark black.

•	Gurang’lii “Blessed Guardian” - Goddess of booze and the hearth. The twin sister of Redouane that is probably the ‘good’ one of her mythological dysfunctional family. She is a guardian of the home and hearth. She is tall, beautiful, athletic, and ridiculously strong. She is quite different from her family as she is actually detailed to be of soft gold fur with streaks of gray and white. She is a kind goddess and if a talisman protects a home, it would be unwise to destroy her seals less you bring the fury of her hounds. Mead is a holy drink as it is hearty, warm, and blessed with everlasting graces under Gurang’lii. To poison mead is to spit upon Gurang’lii’s name, not a good idea.

•	Maas’Taake “The Old One”- God of the Dead and the Judged, an enigma in the Zhan religion, he is the oldest God of them all, yet even the gods don’t even know who he is. He simply is the one that has always been, and always will be, existing and collecting the souls of the dead. He is physically described as a gaunt and old Tajara of greying fur and a long beard reaching the floor. He carries a satchel filled with the souls he collects so he may take them to his realm when he returns.

•	Rak-Keel “Evil Lord”- A truly evil being, he is the god of all things negative, all things unholy and terrible. All of the woes and sins and bad things that occur in the world are caused by Rak-Keel and his minions, the Rak-Saarar (evil beings/ demons). He is a dark furred Tajara but with red eyes. His most notable trait is his left ear is ravaged and torn. He also has the mark of the Oathbreaker. He is the original ‘oathbreaker’. He feeds and grows off the collective despair and sadness of the Tajara.

Lesser beings and mythology

•	Rak-Saarar “Evil beings” – These gaunt skeletal beings do not have a distinct form, sometimes they are vague and horrifying illusions of Tajara. They are usually unseen and can only be seen in the physical world by using a shard of pure ice blessed by Zaa’Keel. There are many ways to call a Rak-Saarar either unintentionally or intentionally, the latter of which is seen as a curse of the highest degree. They are also brought by pure suffering and sadness. Women who lose children in childbirth, mates (of either gender) who lose their lover, orphans, and warriors who lose their close friends are most suspect to these beings. Using a bowl, these demons collect the despair of those that have such powerful negative emotions then bring them to Rak-Keel so that he may feed, then the cycle continues. They are purely parasites.

•	Suuk’Feila “Hounds of Glory”- The hounds of Gurang’lii, these massive six legged creatures are wild creatures of pure and unrestrained glory. Highly territorial and neither good nor evil. They protect the homes blessed by Gurang’lii from Rak-Saarar.  They also exist in the real world as savage hunting animals most akin to wolves, but no attempts have been made to tame these wild creatures that gore anyone who threatens them.

•	Bluuk-Niik “Mighty Ogre”- An ugly creature that defends their homes in the mountains, they do not look like Tajara as they are large hair-less creatures and instead have shards of stone chitin-like plating on their bodies. They are very earthy colored and have four eyes and a large maw full of jagged and sharp teeth. Generally these creatures are certainly negative but not evil. They are the reason behind avalanches and rock slides. If a Zhan dies to such it is believed their bodies are collected by the Niik and eaten. Niiks can be easily tricked with food as they are quite dumb as they generally think with their belly.
	- A major Bluuk-Niik is known as Keel’Niik-Maajar or King of the Mountain Ogres. He is the largest and most ancient of the ogres. He is unique among his kind as he has four arms and a fifth eye. Though his fifth eye was wounded by the great Zhan mythological hero, Ra’Jiil.

•	Taalii’Yuul “Curious Fairies”- a more benevolent but usually unintentionally mischievous. Usually the reason behind the misplacement of objects, the reason doors are left open, and general annoyances. Though they are known to be good and kind hearted beings that are the reason behind the safe return of lost children and pets.

•	Rit-Tuul “Sea Beasts”- The mighty Rit-Tuuls are huge snake like creatures, similar in design of that of human Chinese dragons. These creatures are ancient, old, and wise. They are incredibly rare and said to be the first creatures to grace Adhomai as they tend to reach hundreds of feet long and live deep in the cold oceans and are believed to be the reason behind earthquakes and when the icebergs split and break apart in the oceans. They are called upon in times of great despair for wisdom and guidance. Clans that live near the oceans will build great shrines to these mighty beasts and give offerings of meat to appease them if they rise from the watery depths.

Major Zhan mythology points
	There is a major hero in Zhan culture, Ra’Jiil Ur’Zaa-Khraniizar, the mortal son of Zaa’Keel with the Ur princess Yamarrii Ur-Khraniizar. This great Ur Zhan hero is not like a typical Ur, as he was a soft chocolate/ darker brown fur than that of a typical Ur and a great mane atop of his head, not unlike that of a Terran lion. This grand hero is believed to be the first great king of the Zhan people that united the wild families and roaming groups into actual tribes hundreds of years ago. It is believed those with brown fur are descendants to Ra’Jiil and his original family and are associated with bravery, honor, pride, and freedom. Ra’Jiil is depicted as a tall warrior wearing a vest of chainmail and wielding a great axe, the mark of Zaa’Tura engraved on the head of the weapon.

-While incredibly rare, Albino Zhan do exist. Though the trait is very unlikely to happen and in fact male Albino Zhan are seen as a bad omen, a female Albino is seen as a physical manifestation of Kii’Tura and usually regarded as a living goddess, usually becoming a grand priestess.

Zhan History

The Ur Tribes are the most wild of Zhan, even still to this day. 
The past: To outsiders, not much is known, the Zhan have a highly muddled past filled with conflict and unending violence towards others and even themselves. What is known by outsiders is that the Zhan have been raiders since the beginning, particularly the Zhan Khazan and Ur Zhan. The harsh north in which they live in gives them the thick fur and skin strong enough to survive.
	- In a dog eat dog world, the bigger and stronger the Zhan, the more likely you are to survie.
	- The wide tundra, rolling hills, and sharp mountains has led the Zhan to be able to traverse the most extreme of land conditions. With the harsh conditions of the north both weather and animals the Zhan are generally nomadic, but typically stay in the much colder and reclusive northern regions of Adhomai. The landscape itself is quite barren but great animal migrations sometimes roll through allowing the Zhan to hunt. Ice fishing is common, but generally the most typical and most defining feature of the Zhan, are their raids.
	- Metals are difficult to come by some clans, the major Zhan clan that controls the mountains controls the output of available quality metals, with that the mountains are a hotspot for conflict and territorial disputes.
	- For as long as the tablets and scrolls have foretold the Zhan have always struggled and suffered, what few have spoken with the more open minded tribes these Tajara have rarely known peace. To the point the Ur do not even have the direct Galactic Common word for ‘peace’.  
	- The most common enemy the Ur have is the Njarir-Akhan and the Rakar Tajara for the past empires that had enslaved their people and at several times waged bloody and brutal holy wars to attempt to bring them into the light of S’randarr to which the Zhan have always beaten them back.
	- The Zhan have lived in very feudalistic and clan-based societies. Generally each clan keeps to themselves but there has been several attempts by notable Tajara lords (and even a few female Ur warrior-queens) to reinstall the greatness that was once the mighty kingdom headed by Ra’Jill in the past.
	- While some have succeeded in uniting the clans, unity and peace does not exist for long and often clans will break away and cause civil war due to ancient blood disputes or worse. The longest surviving Kingdom was the Illizaal-Kadaar’Ruuzakarr line headed by Queen Yamani Ruuzakarr which her lineage survived for 200 years before eventually collapsing from internal conflict and incessant clan warfare.
	- Currently there is an unknown amount of Zhan clans, each with their own traditions, lineages, and family structures. Though they all attempt to remain pure on the ancient ways and rarely ever break off less they be scrutinized by other clans.
