### Demons

Demons are a humanoid, spacefaring race that has a history older than most.  Demons typically come in all shapes and sizes, and there are no clear markers for what makes a demon a demon.  They’re far closer to a loose conglomerate of individuals who all proclaim to be under the same banner.  They have a highly social, well involved society that pokes its head in wherever there’s profit or excitement to be had. Demons have a number of notable colonies outside of their homeworld, but each is primarily tied back to their cities on their home planet of Infernum, which have varying and distinct cultures.  Demons typically go against most cultural norms, but due to their varied skillset, useful specializations, and uncanny abilities to influence others through various means, they usually receive some accommodations for themselves. They are locked in an age old struggle with the only other race inhabiting their home system, the Angels. 

### Demon Physiology

Demons come in all shapes and sizes, although most conform to the image gleaned by passages in bible verses or popular culture relating to christian themes, almost strangely so.  Goat legs, unusual red or blue skin colors, unusual hair colors, spaded tails, scaly skin, reptilian features, or goat like features are all heard of and passed around in the demon genepool too frequently to ever label them with one specific set of traits.  Many who find themselves fitting of certain biblical demons often refer to themselves as such, imps, satyrs, devils, etcetera. 

### Infernum

Infernum is a large, hostile planet with largely infertile soil and, a nearly unbearable climate, little water, and frequently igniting gas vents that spew fire from the burning depths of the hostile world.  What little wildlife is here is hardy and durable, the wilds of Infernum often forced to regrow after catastrophe day after day.  What isn’t conquered by demons often changes by the month, wildlife always migrating with food, and food always having to find new ways to not let the killer planet eat them alive. 

### Demon Society

Demon society on infernum is usually segregated into seven different cities or ‘cults’ of belief, While each of these mini-nations has their own capital of the same name, generally they have their own territory ruled by the same ideology.  Strangely, these cities share rough translations and ideas with the ‘seven deadly sins’ of old human christian belief.  Each of these take up a small part of Infernum’s surface, which in most other places is rendered uninhabitable by it’s harsh and near burning environment.  

Despite differences in all of the city’s respective cultures, a few things remain consistent amongst demons.  Oftentimes niceties and politeness come off as condescending and ‘fake’ when perceived by a demon.  Oftentimes the more correct thing to do is address things exactly like you actually think of them, regardless of negative or positive thoughts.  Honesty and brutality are almost always core tenets of demon culture.  However, that’s not to say that their capacity for misdirection can’t be tapped into when they want something.  

### Demon Language

Demons primarily speak Infernal, a twisted, often disturbing chanting that has many different ties to Enochian’s complexity.  People often find it much easier to learn than the high pitched, beautiful song of their angel neighbors.  Citing the language as simply clicking with the mind easier.  

### Galactic Influence

While demons have a great many colonies outside of infernum, most are disorganized, independent, and simply not notable when compared to the great territories of the burning planet.  Demons fairly frequently poke their head into intergalactic politics however, often to devastating effect.  GreedCorp specifically has been known to corrupt and lobby for their interests on a regular basis, and the Lords of Lust are nearly never far behind.  Demons are well equipped at dismantling and modifying angel tech, and taps in the extensive angel sensory array of listening posts are commonplace for rich demons.  As much as the Angels try, nearly always a demonic culture will learn about something through their own lines before so much as a word pops up onto their screen. 


### Demonic Territories and Cultures

##### Lust

Lust is a territory of excess and excitement.  It’s exceptionally small when compared to other territories, but it can be equated to a casino, brothel, and extraterrestrial wildlife reserve all rolled into one.  Most permanent residents of lust serve the various establishments there, and a large portion of it’s populace is actually comprised of visitors from other demonic territories on Infernum.  It’s common for demonic residents of lust to refer to themselves as succubi or incubi.

What little territory Lust occupies has been terraformed through ‘generous donations’ from other richer territories like Pride and Greed, not to mention what may have come from other galactic societies, turning the entire area around it into a lush paradise.   It has its own biosphere complete with wildlife imported from Sanctum, Earth, Moghes, and Qerrbalak alike, carefully groomed into its own living ecosystem.  Nobody is sure what exactly keeps the area so much cooler and the soil so much more rich than it is on the rest of the planet, but hushed whispers of stolen angel tech merged with the work of a corrupt and perverted Skrellian scientist are the leading explanation.  Nobody has actually laid witness to the mechanism at work, but one would have to imagine massive subterranean tunnels of terraforming and atmospheric equipment.  What can be confirmed is that there are vents coming from underground all around the territory, keeping the air fresh and clear. 

This paradise like environment is seamlessly integrated with the beautiful aesthetics of the resort-like, well tended garden city itself.  Many casinos and buildings have small exteriors that stretch far underground in an impressive feat of architecture and city planning.  The tops of buildings often have beautiful hanging gardens well tended to by contracted succubi gardeners.  

The casinos and brothels below the city are always abuzz with activity, and ruthlessly compete with one another as to who can pull in the most customers per day.  The lords of Lust are as varied as they come, each owning one of the massive subterranean establishments that are the city’s claim to fame. They pride themselves on who can satisfy their customers the best, lavishing important visitors in gifts, consorts, and the freedom to use exclusive services.  It’s not unheard of for politicians in solgov to be bribed with all expense paid trips to Lust, with good reason. 

Protected unions for prostitution are commonplace, and offer many benefits to the age-old profession’s practicers.  It keeps sex in the city as safer and cleaner than you’d find anywhere else, and more well regulated too.  Each of lust’s establishments typically hosts its own union, allowing them to offer better services from their most practiced experts to any VIPs that may require impressing. 

Lust has a running rivalry with greed, who continually attempts to buy out or undercut many of the larger establishments in the city.  They find little to no success in the effort, but many succubi would rather go bankrupt then sell their property to greed.  Bringing up one city in the other often elicits snide remarks and sneers.

##### Gluttony

Gluttony is a territory of excess in a whole different sense.  It’s the breadbasket of Infernum, a center for innovation in how best to feed the planet’s populace, and make a nice penny exporting the excess.   It’s mostly comprised of massive complexes that breed genetically altered food products of all different make.  The center of the city is dominated by various kitchens and food production companies.  Gluttony covers the largest amount of land among any of the sedentary territories. 

Gluttony’s sprawling network of fields, pens, and factories dominates most of it’s expansive territory, almost all of them producing some different and experimental crop.  Every single experiment is constantly driven to make the food bigger, more delicious, and more inexpensive.  It’s hard to come across anything natural in gluttony, but even harder to come across any food for free.  

Most of Gluttony’s populace is comprised of chefs, mechanics, and scientists.   Each tending to the massive food production machine in their own way.  There’s also a few logistical professionals that oversee the export of food products, specifically the ever flowing export of luxury products to Lust and Pride.  

There’s no small amount of tourism to see the massive and prestigious restaurant complexes there either.  Scouting agencies from all around the galaxy often look for cooks certified in gluttony for hiring in high up establishments across the galaxy, usually paying the good ones a king’s ransom. 

The social constructs of gluttony are a constant series of priding oneself on a new dish, making something bigger, better, more filling, tastier than the last.  It’s truly an insatiable economy of creation and consumption.  The menus at each and every restaurant seldom have dishes that stick around for over five years.

##### Greed

Greed isn’t so much a territory as it is a massive, sprawling metropolis.  It stands tall with massive skyscrapers in defiance of the miles of open, burning plains surrounding it, construction crews often working to tame the landscape before claiming yet more territory.  Greed has the most spaceports on the planet, and as such is often referred to as the planet’s general center of commerce.  It’s hard to find an offworld product being sold on Infernum that hasn’t been passed through Greed at one point or another.  The strangest part?  It’s all owned and loaned out by a single monopoly, GreedCorp.  The company seems to have been a central part of the city for eons, even owing its current name to the all encompassing business. 

Greed typically makes its money in logistics, legal jargon, and ruthless deals with other space faring races.  Despite their size, most of their business happens offworld.  GreedCorp often sinks its paws into just about anything and everything, mining rights, trade routes, construction, manufacturing, there’s even rumors of trained mercenaries being recruited and contracted out of greed.  

GreedCorp is also often contracted by outside powers to help conduct negotiations and contract agreements.  Due to their large corporate thinktanks and lawyers well versed in any known codes of law used by other races, they are often quite adept at this task- they have an unbelievably high success rate.  They also usually ask for alternative payment rather than a flat fee- the price may not be worth the deal you get, success or not. 

While greed’s tendrils are far reaching, owning large parts of Sloth, Gluttony, and Envy, they seem to be stuck out of the deal when it comes to the resort city, Lust.  While they certainly make deals with Lust, it seems that their autonomy is secured from the sheer amount of galactic attention that the place receives.  Most lords of lust would instead go bankrupt then sell their businesses to greed, something that GreedCorp has taken notice of.  These two cities share a rivalry ages old, often bringing up one in the other will elicit sneers and scoffs. 

Life in greed is far less stellar and scenic than the beautiful skyscrapers may initially lead you to believe.  Generally, if you aren’t useful to the corporation, you aren’t useful;  If you aren’t useful, Greed can make you useful.  Call centers, cafeteria workers, accountants, salesmen, ditch diggers, janitors, construction workers, etcetera.  There’s no shortage of jobs in greed.  No matter who you are, Greed will place you somewhere, and you will work.  

##### Sloth

Sloth is what can be amounted to as a massive factory the size of a city.  While comprised of many, many different facilities- the streets are comprised of domed, cooled conveyor belts, moving seating, all in programmable pathways between the large, solar panel covered metallic cubes of factory complexes and homes.  Sometimes both rolled into one.  Sloth is the industrial powerhouse and the technological innovator on Infernum, but most of the innovation they do is just making those jobs as simple and easy as possible. 

For most demons living in sloth, interaction with machinery is their day to day lives.  Programming it, keeping it running, informing machines to make repairs, diagnostics, problem solving, creating failsafes, improvement, etcetera.  It’s nearly all they do.  Of course, whoever a slothites employer is typically pays them a large amount of money to keep the machines up and running, and often withhold pay should there be excessive downtime.  While this would be the demon’s job, they often go about it with a sort of lackadaisical uncaring, except for when it might come back to bite them.  Sloth mechanic and programmer subculture entirely revolves around making a machine so perfect it nearly fixes itself, and does everything for you.  The city itself is the result of that obsession.

The mechanical city does nearly everything for you.  It wakes you up, it cooks you breakfast, it showers you, it brushes your teeth, it dresses you up and walks you to work, where it then proceeds to adjust your chair however you want and bring you snacks and coffee from the frequently used breakroom.  Most residents of sloth end up making or modifying systems to work for themselves specifically, there’s no city committee keeping track of all of this- it’s all idiot proofed by disgruntled users.  

Sloth has a production quota unlike any other factory, creating hundreds of thousands of products for both onworld and offworld clients, almost any product being shipped offworld has passed through sloth at least for packaging, if nothing else.  Half of the city is owned by GreedCorp, the other parts taking orders from independent gluttony businesses, or places in lust. 

Technological literacy and genius is an essential skill to live here for any period of time.  The sheer amount of civilian created robots and interfaces lining the streets require constant tinkering and maintenance in order to bypass with minimal effort.  It’s almost antithetical to the laziness and ease of access they’re usually created to preserve. 

While obviously largely powered by solar energy, sloth actually pulls most of its power from massive geothermal generators established in the burning landscape surrounding the city in ages long past, theorized to be created in order to bypass paying for power or using something that’d require more maintenance. 

##### Wrath

Wrath is a great exception amongst the demon’s cultures.  They don’t have a set location, or even really a set population.  Wrath is comprised of one of three known travelling caravans of demons, all surviving in the highly specialized, highly dangerous volcanic wildlands of infernum.

Wrath is referred to as a sort of boogeyman amongst most of the territories, often raiding transports, stealing food, stealing technology, scrapping vehicles, taking anything and everything that isn’t bolted down and may assist their hit and run survival out in the harsh burning landscape.  

Wrath seems to be obsessed with speed and force, striking down an enemy, bringing them low, and taking what is theirs before they even have a chance to react.  So much so that this is their primary form of authority and governance.  The leader of Wrath is whomever can forcibly shut everyone else up long enough to give out orders.  This person is known as a ‘Khan’ and is always regarded as an exceptionally strong warrior.  While duels for supremacy are rare, this isn’t out of a sense of order in the caravan, it’s simply because these people live and breathe battle.  They constantly watch one another, keeping tabs on who is and isn’t stronger, improvements, decay.  One only fights when one is sure of victory, and training dedication and power ensure victory.  

Wrath caravans often move in an unpredictable pattern between predetermined drop points and previously set up encampments, often created sites or scavenged and repurposed buildings from territories long past repurposed to be able to become set up or abandoned quickly.  Wrath never stays in one place for too long, but when they leave they often have more than they came with. 

Wrath also has a subclass of mechanics, most enamored with the idea of creating vehicles that can move fast and carry through a speedy assault.  Speed and precision are tenets of their guerilla fighting style, and it carries through in nearly everything that these mechanics build.  While one might imagine that Wrath is confined to the surface of Infernum, occasionally a group of these mechanics will have built a small fleet of ships, entirely geared towards sabotaging angelic vessels or GreedCorp transports.  Most wrath tech looks cobbled together and scavenged from their surroundings, but often work to deadly effect.

##### Envy

Envy is situated in a massive valley, leading down into a yawning crevasse in Infernum’s surface that seemingly leads deep into the planet’s crust.  The entirety of the territory’s economy is centered around taking everything possible from the weathered and age old bisection of their planet’s rocky outer layer, often taking any risks required and taking out any competition possible.  

The scar in the earth that envy is built on is anomalous in that it contains many useful and often rare materials that can be easily sold for a high price if information is given to the correct people.  The people of envy are often caught chasing an improbable dream of getting rich quick, and often fight one another directly over who’s going to get their next big score.  

Many interstellar mining guilds from both across Infernum and across the galaxy take up a presence in Envy, however not many stay long.  The cutthroat competition doesn’t stop at it’s citizens, after all.  With how little regulations there are on infernum, petty sabotage and seizure of another company’s property is a frequent and real threat for any investors.  

There’s a real possibility to get rich in envy, if you’re clever, skilled, and ruthless.  Many find themselves killed in the gulch, or worse.  There are no lords of envy, and it’s not even officially a territory- it’s simply what the area has been labeled over years of settlement and infighting. 

##### Pride

Pride is situated in a large, cozy valley safe from most of the planet’s violent weather and outbursts.  It too is an exception in it’s disorganization, the entire territory is more an uncollected territory of mansions, support structures, gardens, pools, all curled up and interlocked with one another.  One can swear that the walls and fence posts change in position from time to time.  The populace is about what you’d expect from such an area, usually extended families of ancient demon bloodlines, funded by old crypts of money.  Usually they have an extended suite of staff that tend to nearly everything for them, and often have an extensive list of rituals, customs, and regular gatherings between families fuelled by a genuine social desire to prove themselves as better than one another.  The residents of Pride often refer to themselves as Royals, or Archdemons- but the title has little meaning outside of Pride, simply means the demon has more money.  

Nobody quite knows when pride was formed, but it’s rumored to be older than any of the other current territories, the logbooks of some family crypts going back to humanity’s  prehistory and beyond.  There’s been a history of families coming and going under new heads, but most tend to float through careful investment of funds and hired experts from other territories, most often Greed.  

Visitors are seldom welcome in the gated community of Pride, always having to carry the seal of the house that brought them in.  Even then, they’ll often be judged in accordance to the extensive list of customs involved in dealing with said family, which often require extensive research to even begin to practice.  As such, Pride families are often careful in who they associate with.  

Midnight parties and gatherings amongst the nobility have been reported to actually be quite fun once you get the hang of the social intrigue and careful rituals involved, the families in the mess of courtyards often seem to find their biggest form of entertainment in one another.  However, the families also seem intent on presiding over the entire complex, age old family rivalries and even raids have been documented throughout Pride’s history, although should a family want to pull the trigger, the use of assassins and careful placement of heirs is always more favored.
